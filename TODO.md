# Confluence Sync Tool - Development Plan

## Overview
This project aims to create a suite of Python scripts to synchronize content between Confluence spaces and local directories. The tool supports bidirectional syncing, with conflict resolution, and converts Confluence pages to/from Markdown format.

## Architecture
- **Config Module**: Handles user credentials and space configuration
- **API Module**: Manages communication with Confluence API
- **Sync Module**: Core logic for syncing content bidirectionally
- **Converter Module**: Handles conversion between Confluence markup and Markdown
- **CLI Module**: Command-line interface for user interaction

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Configuration
- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Implement credential storage and management
- [x] Implement space configuration storage
- [x] Create basic CLI framework

### Phase 2: Basic Confluence API Integration
- [x] Implement authentication with Confluence API
- [x] Implement page retrieval functionality
- [x] Implement page creation/update functionality
- [x] Add error handling and rate limiting

### Phase 3: Content Conversion
- [x] Implement Confluence markup to Markdown conversion
- [x] Implement Markdown to Confluence markup conversion
- [x] Handle attachments and embedded content
- [x] Support for page hierarchies and links

### Phase 4: Sync Functionality
- [x] Implement pull functionality (Confluence → Local)
- [x] Implement push functionality (Local → Confluence)
- [x] Add metadata tracking for sync state
- [x] Implement conflict detection

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [x] Implement bidirectional sync with conflict resolution
- [x] Add support for batch operations
- [x] Add logging and reporting

### Phase 6: Testing and Documentation
- [x] Create user documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
- [ ] Add examples and usage scenarios
- [ ] Perform security review

### Phase 7: Bug Fixes and Improvements
- [x] Fix attachment upload functionality in the API client
- [x] Improve error handling for attachment operations
- [x] Fix download_attachment method in the API client
- [x] Add better support for image references in Markdown files
- [x] Improve handling of special characters in file names
- [x] Add progress reporting for attachment operations
- [x] Implement retry mechanism for failed API calls
- [ ] Fix image reference conversion issue
  - [ ] Implement improved HTML preprocessing to handle attachment images
  - [ ] Update image reference matching logic to better handle various formats

## Current Focus
We have completed Phases 1-4 and most of Phase 5. The tool now supports bidirectional synchronization between Confluence spaces and local directories, with HTML-to-Markdown and Markdown-to-HTML conversion. We have also implemented conflict detection and resolution during sync operations.

Recent improvements:
1. Fixed attachment upload and download functionality with robust error handling
2. Added batch operations for attachments to improve performance
3. Improved progress reporting for attachment operations
4. Enhanced image reference handling in Markdown files
5. Added better error logging for attachment operations

## Next Steps
1. Implement caching for improved performance
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Add more examples and usage scenarios
4. Perform security review
5. Add support for additional Confluence features (e.g., macros, tables)
6. Improve synchronization performance for large spaces
